### Glossary of terms

**Artificial Intelligence:** is a broad concept referring to a program's ability to learn by itself and solve sophisticated tasks. Machine Learning is a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence, which comprises a variety of algorithms enabling programs to solve tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so. You can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_uwKZIAeM0) an overview of this technology. The concept of Machine Learning encompasses many statistical methods that have been around for decades, to which recent technological progress has given a new vigor.

**Artificial Neural Network:** is a class of algorithms comprising many interconnected units called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each unit processes information and can transmit a signal to other units. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a very flexible class of algorithms able to learn from large datasets. They underpin many Machine Learning applications, such as image and video recognition or natural language processing.
