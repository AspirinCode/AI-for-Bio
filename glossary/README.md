### Glossary of terms

**- Artificial Intelligence:** is a broad concept referring to a program's ability to learn by itself and solve sophisticated tasks. Machine Learning is a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence, which comprises a variety of algorithms enabling programs to solve tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so. You can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_uwKZIAeM0) an overview of this technology. The concept of Machine Learning encompasses many statistical methods that have been around for decades, to which recent technological progress has given a new vigor.

**- Artificial Neural Network:** is a class of algorithms comprising many interconnected units called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each unit processes information and can transmit a signal to other units. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a very flexible class of algorithms able to learn from large datasets. They underpin many Machine Learning applications, such as image and video recognition or natural language processing. You can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi&index=3) a deeper explanation of how ANNs work.

**- Supervised Learning:** As opposed to unsupervised learning (where there is no output variable to guide the learning process and data is explored by algorithms to find patterns), in supervised learning your existing data is already labelled and you know which behaviour you want to predict in the new data you obtain. This is the type of algorithms that autonomous cars use to recognize pedestrians and objects, or organizations exploit to estimate customers lifetime value and their churn rates.
In a way, supervised learning is like learning with a teacher, and then apply that knowledge to new data.

**- Unsupervised Learning:**  means there is no output variable to guide the learning process (no this or that, no right or wrong) and data is explored by algorithms to find patterns. We only observe the features but have no established measurements of the outcomes since we want to find them out. As opposed to supervised learning where your existing data is already labeled and you know which behaviour you want to determine in the new data you obtain, unsupervised learning techniques donâ€™t use labelled data and the algorithms are left to themselves to discover structures in the data.
