## Datasets

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) | PubChem is an open chemistry database at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). PubChem mostly contains small molecules, but also larger molecules such as nucleotides, carbohydrates, lipids, peptides, and chemically-modified macromolecules. We collect information on chemical structures, identifiers, chemical and physical properties, biological activities, patents, health, safety, toxicity data, and many others. |
| [EMBL’s European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/services/data-resources-and-tools) | EMBL’s European Bioinformatics Institute maintains the world’s most comprehensive range of freely available and up-to-date molecular data resources. |
| [National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) | The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. |
| [Ensembl](http://www.ensembl.org/index.html) | Ensembl is a genome browser for vertebrate genomes that supports research in comparative genomics, evolution, sequence variation and transcriptional regulation. Ensembl annotate genes, computes multiple alignments, predicts regulatory function and collects disease data. Ensembl tools include BLAST, BLAT, BioMart and the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) for all supported species. |
| [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/) | The Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) is a comprehensive resource for protein sequence and annotation data. UniProt is a collaboration between the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics and the Protein Information Resource (PIR). Across the three institutes more than 100 people are involved through different tasks such as database curation, software development and support. |
| [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/) | The Protein Data Bank (PDB) was established as the 1st open access digital data resource in all of biology and medicine (Historical Timeline). It is today a leading global resource for experimental data central to scientific discovery. |
| [LINCS L1000](https://lincsproject.org/LINCS/tools/workflows/find-the-best-place-to-obtain-the-lincs-l1000-data)  | The LINCS L1000 project has collected gene expression profiles for thousands of perturbagens at a variety of time points, doses, and cell lines. |
| [proGenomes](https://progenomes.embl.de/genome.cgi) | proGenomes provides consistently annotated bacterial and archaeal genomes containing billions of genes from over 40,000 species. Strict quality controls are employed for the included genomes to enable accurate analyses. The genomes can be interactively explored and downloaded, whereby subsets can be customized e.g. taxonomic clades, representatives of each species or habitat-specific subsets. For each specI species cluster, precomputed pangenomes are available. |
| [The Cancer Genome Atlas Program](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga) | The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a landmark cancer genomics program, molecularly characterized over 20,000 primary cancer and matched normal samples spanning 33 cancer types. This joint effort between NCI and the National Human Genome Research Institute began in 2006, bringing together researchers from diverse disciplines and multiple institutions. |
| [The American Gut project](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB11419) | The American Gut project is the largest crowdsourced citizen science project to date. Fecal, oral, skin, and other body site samples collected from thousands of participants represent the largest human microbiome cohort in existence. Detailed health and lifestyle and diet data associated with each sample is enabling us to deeply examine associations between the human microbiome and factors such as diet (from vegan to near carnivore and everything in between), season, amount of sleep, and disease states such as IBD, diabetes, or autism spectrum disorder-as well as many other factors not listed here. The American Gut project also encompasses the British Gut and Australian Gut projects, widening the cohort beyond North America. |
