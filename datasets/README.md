| [LINCS L1000](https://lincsproject.org/LINCS/tools/workflows/find-the-best-place-to-obtain-the-lincs-l1000-data)  | The LINCS L1000 project has collected gene expression profiles for thousands of perturbagens at a variety of time points, doses, and cell lines. |
| [proGenomes](https://progenomes.embl.de/genome.cgi) | proGenomes provides consistently annotated bacterial and archaeal genomes containing billions of genes from over 40,000 species. Strict quality controls are employed for the included genomes to enable accurate analyses. The genomes can be interactively explored and downloaded, whereby subsets can be customized e.g. taxonomic clades, representatives of each species or habitat-specific subsets. For each specI species cluster, precomputed pangenomes are available. |
